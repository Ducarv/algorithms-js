# Data Structure: Hash Table

A **hash table** is a data structure that offers an efficient way to store and retrieve values based on keys. It is widely used in programming due to its speed in data retrieval. This JavaScript implementation of a hash table uses an array as the underlying structure.

## Basic Concept

A hash table is like a large ledger with numbered pages. Each page (index) can contain multiple entries. When you want to store or retrieve information, the hash table uses a special function called a **hash function** to map a key (e.g., a word) to a number (index).

In the provided source code, the `_hash` method calculates the hash value for a given key using the ASCII values of the key's characters. This value is then mapped to an index in the underlying array. This way, the hash table provides fast access to values associated with keys, making it efficient for search and retrieval operations.

## How to Use

```javascript
    // Create a new hash table
    const ht = new HashTable();

    // Add values to the hash table
    ht.set("apple", "red");
    ht set("apricot", "orange");
    ht.set("banana", "yellow");

    // Retrieve values from the hash table
    console.log(ht.get("apple")); // Output: "red"

    // Remove values from the hash table
    ht.remove("banana");

    // Display the content of the hash table
    ht.display();
```

Implementation Details
Hash Function
The \_hash function is responsible for calculating the hash value of a key. It traverses the key's characters, sums their ASCII values, and returns a valid index in the hash table.

### Adding Values

The set method allows adding key-value pairs to the hash table. If a key already exists, it updates the corresponding value.

### Retrieving Values

The get method retrieves the value associated with a specific key.

### Removing Values

The remove method deletes a key-value pair from the hash table.

### Display

The display method shows the content of the hash table, revealing how entries are distributed across its indices.

### Structure of the Hash Table

The hash table consists of an array where each element is, in fact, an inner array. Each inner array contains key-value pairs, allowing efficient data organization.

### Conclusion

Hash tables are powerful data structures for efficient search and retrieval operations. This JavaScript implementation offers a clear insight into how the structure works, along with basic operations for effective data management.
