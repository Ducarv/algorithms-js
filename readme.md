## Introduction

Programming algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. They provide efficient solutions to various computational problems. This repository aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations of these algorithms in JavaScript to help you learn and understand them.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of algorithms currently included in this repository:

1. **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.
2. **Selection Sort**: Simple, inefficient sorting. Repeatedly picks smallest, appends to sorted.
3. **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.
4. **QuickSort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the "Divide and Conquer" approach to sort elements in an array or list.

Feel free to explore these algorithms and their implementations in JavaScript.
