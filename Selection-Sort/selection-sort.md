### Selection Sort

# Concepts:

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from an unsorted part of the array and putting it in its correct position in the sorted part of the array. This process continues until the whole array is sorted.

# Example:

Imagine you have a deck of playing cards, and you want to arrange them in ascending order based on their face value (ignoring suits). Here's how selection sort works:

Initial Deck: [5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 1, 8, 4, 7]

Find the minimum card in the unsorted part of the deck (starting from the first card). In this case, it's 1.

Swap the minimum card (1) with the first unsorted card (5).

Deck after First Pass: [1, 2, 9, 3, 6, 5, 8, 4, 7]

Now, consider the remaining unsorted part of the deck (excluding the first card, which is already sorted), and find the minimum card. It's 2.

Swap the minimum card (2) with the first unsorted card in this remaining part (3).

Deck after Second Pass: [1, 2, 9, 3, 6, 5, 8, 4, 7]

Repeat this process until the entire deck is sorted.

Deck after Full Sorting: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Selection sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large datasets, but it's simple to understand and implement. It repeatedly finds the minimum element and moves it to its correct position, gradually building a sorted array.
